*“Make America Great Again! [...] I would be the best jobs President that God ever created. 
Let’s get to work!” - Donald Trump*

<br>

Donald Trump has always been half-man, half-cartoon; shocking and amazing the public with an ostentatious lack of taste, sporting his famed toupee, and littering his buildings with massive TRUMP signs. 
  
Somewhere along the line, though, this life must have gotten boring for “the Donald.” 
  
Trump's decision to consider running for president, in 2011, indicated that he was no longer content to merely be a mediocre businessman; he wanted to become the American Silvio Berlusconi. 
  
This year, he's running again, his racism on full display. The potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate has recently conjectured that “the Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States.”1 
  
These are people that are, according to Trump, “in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.”, making the United States “a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.” He also claimed that “infectious disease is pouring across the border,” which must be a Mexican only thing, because European-Americans have no history of this, whatsoever.
  
To soften his racism, Trump said “many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it.” Of course, this only applies to the Mexicans that are here “legally.” According to Trump, the “good” Mexicans “are severely hurt” by the “bad” Mexicans who come in “illegally.” 
  
Trump is right in a way; there are drug dealers and rapists illegally coming into the United States from Mexico. But to insinuate that most undocumented Mexicans are rapists and murders is racist and factually incorrect; the majority of illegal immigrants are just trying to escape from poverty and escalating drug violence. 
  
The question is: what moral high ground does Trump occupy when his country is the world's largest arms exporter? Or when the United States has the world's highest consumption of illegal drugs (helping to fuel a drug war that is responsible for the arrival of many of the “rogue” elements that Trump detests)?
  
The passage of NAFTA, in 1993, created a “free trade” zone in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It also ensured that cheap (government subsidized) North American agriculture would flood the Mexican marketplace, managing to put millions of Mexican farmers out of business, and on the path to the United States. And yet, Trump finds the relationship between the United States and Mexico to be “totally one sided in [Mexico's] favor on both illegal immigration and trade.”
  
In short, Donald Trump and his ilk are helping to create the very situation that they later complain about.
  
One could say that a lot of Trump's popularity comes from the backlash against the culture of (so-called) “political correctness.” When Macy’s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR decided to cut ties with Trump, he responded that they “have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct,” and do not know “what is good for our country.” 
  
During a recent GOP debate, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly made light of his sexist remarks: “Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However that is not without its downsides, in particular when it comes to women. You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. Your twitter account--”2
  
Trump interrupted: “Only Rosie O'Donnell.”
  
“For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O’Donnell,” retorted Kelly.

“I'm sure it was,” Trump conceded.

Kelley continued with her question: “Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant [on your TV show] that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how do you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?”3

Trump, “The big problem this country has is being politically correct. I've been challenged by so many people and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to China, we lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.”

It's not just a small section of the business elite that's annoyed with political correctness; according to a 2014 poll, 61% of Americans think that the United States is “too politically correct.”4

One consequence of a more “politically correct” United States is some comedians have stopped playing college shows, due to what they see as the overwhelming presence of the “PC police.” Jerry Seinfeld remarked that college students “just want to use these [politically correct] words: 'That’s racist;' 'That’s sexist;' 'That’s prejudice',” but “don’t even know what the fuck they’re talking about.”5 He thinks that political correctness is killing comedy. 

Chris Rock has also “stopped playing colleges” because, in his view, students nowadays are “way too conservative.”6 Not conservative “in their political views,” but “in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody.” We've come a long way from a time when, as Mick Hume noted, “the complaints were about blasphemous and indecent comedy, and the censors were conservative politicians, policemen and priests. Now the protests are more often against comedians accused of breaking the new taboos – racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and the other usual suspects. And the demands to shut them down tend to be led not by old-fashioned prudes but by radical online activists, the liberal media and even other comedians.”7

Political correctness is typically associated with the left wing, but is not entirely uncontroversial there. The world's most well-known contemporary philosopher, Slavoj Žižek, conceives of political correctness as a form of totalitarianism. When speaking about the relationship between political correctness and racism, he commented that “my problem with political correctness [is that] it's just a form of self-discipline, which, doesn't really allow you to overcome racism. It's just oppressed, controlled racism”8; perhaps we can call it “diet Racism” or “racism-light”? Žižek's conclusion was that “there is something so fake about political correctness. It's...I know it's better than open racism, of course, but I wonder if it works.” As Stewart Lee put it, “if political correctness has achieved one thing, it is to make the Conservative party [in England] cloak its inherent racism behind more creative language.”9

With the idea of political correctness being bombarded from all sides, one may wonder; who is responsible for this supposed monster?

The aforementioned “radical online activists” and “the liberal media” are currently part of the PC police, but the phenomenon of political correctness goes back much further. To identify the “culprits,” we will have to go back to the 1960's, examining that motley crew of radicals known as the New Left.


*Old Left, New Left, Post New Left*

*“I would think that if you understood what communism was, you would hope, you would pray on your knees, that we would someday become communists.” - Jane Fonda (1970)*

The typical narrative of the 1960s is told from the point of view of its main protagonist, the “counterculture.” Political upheaval, meanwhile, plays a supporting role; it becomes lost in a thick cloud of smoke and psychedelic patterns; drowned out in  rock and roll and “sexual liberation.”10

One of the New Left's distinguishing features is that it tended to side with the counterculture; the Old Left, on the other hand, resembled a disapproving parent. 

The New Left thought the Old Left was behind the times. It's main achievements were decades before, in the Russian or Spanish Revolutions11, and their efforts were often seen as the struggles of the (white, male) working-class.12

Involvement in the counterculture of the 60s and 70s was certainly a bone of contention between the “Old” and “New” Left, as well as being something that was debated in those circles internally. A good example of this generational gap was given by Christopher Hitchens, a former Trotskyite turned liberal cretin. He claimed that his former Trotskyist group “had a relaxed and humorous internal life and also a quizzical and critical attitude to the 'Sixties' mindset.”13 

They didn’t grow long hair, because they “wanted to mingle with the workers on the factory gate and on the housing estates.” The man who drank his liver into oblivion claimed that they also “didn’t 'do' drugs.” He regarded them as a “pathetic, weak-minded escapism” that was “almost as contemptible as religion.”

They weren't totally opposed to the counterculture however; “long hair and drugs were out, but rock and roll and sex were OK.” 

Some tried this “moderate” approach, while others took more radical positions in embracing or vigorously denouncing the new counterculture. The right liked to portray it as the “moral degeneration” of the youth, while certain leftists argued that the counterculture contained the seeds of anti-capitalist revolt, and others viciously attacked it, claiming that it was a distraction, and a form of de-politicization. And, in a way, they were correct: a lot of people were perhaps too focused on getting high and jamming out, rather than tackling the immediate problems at hand.

The “counterculture” and the “political” did not form separate containers, and were part of the same milieu. Still, there was a slight distance between them. Some in the “counterculture” were more “political,” while others leaned towards the “a-political.” 

Kommune 1 was on the “political” end of the counterculture, its founding members coming from the Socialist German Student Union (SDS). They were opposed to what they called “bourgeois” culture and its accompanying concepts like personal privacy; accordingly, their bathrooms were without doors. Leaders  and authority figures were said to have been abolished, and the only 

Most importantly, the patriarchal nuclear family was seen as the basic building block of capitalism, and in particular, fascism. They sought to challenge its presence in every sphere of bourgeois life by living out the slogan, “the personal is the political.” “Mainstream” norms, like short hair for men, abstinence from drug use, or sexual exclusivity, were cast aside for those of the emergent counterculture.

The members of Komune 1 became celebrities due to their off-beat lifestyles, and absurdist political theater, the idea of “joke as weapon.”14 Some of their numerous acts of provocation include throwing hundreds of Little Red Books from the roof of a famous church in Berlin,15 and printing fake SDS pamphlets that declared, “water cannons are paper tigers.” 

Their growing notoriety brought famous guests, like Jimi Hendrix, as well as the media. Typically, the commune tried go beyond capitalist private property, and the idea of doing something for reward rather than passion. Living in capitalism does produce certain restraints, and so they interacted with the media on the condition that the commune got paid for any interview or photo shoot.


More than a bunch of dirty hippies though, the New Left was first and foremost a political movement, its origins lying before the rise of the counterculture.16 

Take yourself back to 1956. The left political landscape is dominated by Social-Democracy and (soviet) Marxism-Leninism, and the biggest decision is choosing between reformism (S-D) and “revolution” (M-L)17. 

The backdrop is a post-war economic boom that lasts until the late 60s - early 70s; the “Golden” Age of Capitalism. With fascism defeated, and “communism” lurking in the background, revolution is not the order of the day. Moderates abound; most have already chosen reform, and many Social-Democratic parties are experiencing their heyday. Even the Moscow affiliated communist parties have become more moderate.18 

The key concept is cooperation (between bosses and workers). A 1963 Fortune headline will eventually read, “Unions Are Worth The Price.” The “compromise,” in the industrial sectors, is a system of increased output (and decreased workplace control) for increased wages.

All of this brings a level of affluence to the working class (in advanced industrialized countries) that has never been seen before or since. The welfare state is vastly expanded, and unemployment rates are kept low in most countries. 

The gap between the rich and the poor is appalling, but is reduced in scale to where it will be, in 2015.  In the United States, the (marginal) tax rate for the top income bracket in 2015 will be 39.6%. In 1956, it is 91%.

In short, everything seemed to be on the right track. 


Except for a few things, of course. The working class was not always content. Jim Crow still existed in the southern United States, and decolonization was only beginning to happen. “Women” were oppressed in a more outright way, not to speak of queer people. And the threat of nuclear warfare hung over humanity.

The New Left was on a mission to tear down the facade of this “harmonious society.” It included not only “mainstream” capitalist society, but also the Old Left.

The breaking point for many was the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Hungarians had rose up and established democratic councils in their workplaces and communities, which took the place of the disposed government. 

Like other great revolutionary moments, it showed people that another world was possible; this is why it wasn't long before Soviet tanks rolled in and crushed it. The Hungarians bravely fought the Soviet tanks, with everything from armed adults to thirteen year olds with molotov cocktails. The movement was defeated, but its spirit found a new home amongst the New Left.

Earlier that year, Nikita Kruschev had given his famous “Secret Speech,” where he listed some of Stalin's crimes (in an attempt to win back the party from those loyal to the recently deceased Stalin). This was a moment of crisis for many communists, but Kruschev seemed to be offering a slightly de-Stalinized route and so some stayed on. The invasion of Hungary in 1956, though, is where many drew the line, and left “the party.” Some went to the right, becoming social-democrats, liberals, even conservatives. Some, however, went further to the Left.

This is the beginning of the New Left; what was “new” was its rejection of the “old” ways of doing leftist politics, mainly Stalinist Communism and Social-Democracy. 

It also found its roots in many post-war events, like the civil rights movement in the United States, the decolonization movements, and the Chinese and Cuban revolutions. Members of the New Left could be found within the working class, the wealthy19 or the unemployed, but many of its main spokespeople were university students or professors.

In the US, the Berkeley Free Speech movement (1964-1965) kicked off the wave of worldwide student protest.20

The “cooperation” mentality had produced a predictable result at Berkeley; a “liberal” university administration that wanted the university environment to be as “a-political” as possible. 

Specifically, the administration prohibited political groups or causes from tabling, which is a prime way to distribute information and literature, receive donations, and get new members. A small strip of sidewalk that had been an unofficial “safety valve” was now closed. 

The results were explosive.

At the height of the Civil Rights movement, CORE (the Congress of Racial Equality) decided to fight the ban21. They set up a table, and were promptly accosted by the university administration. They  refused to leave, and the police tried to arrest an ex Berkeley grad student. A spontaneous crowd formed to block the police, and were spurred on by experienced Civil Rights activist. Hundreds of people were gathering. Some climbed on top of the immobilized cop car to give speeches. For many it was their first protest.

By the end of the day, the car roof had become “one large dent,”22 and the University administration was now facing significant resistance.

This was a tactic of direct action, or actions that are not centered around negotiation; other kinds of direct action include sit-down strikes, and illegal demonstrations. Direct action works best when the existing routes to change are blocked, or are slow moving. 

For example, when the Supreme Court “legally” desegregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education, they claimed that it should occur with “all deliberate speed.” It was a vague phrase that put an accent on “deliberation” rather than “speed.” 

A legal milestone had given way to an institutional problem; how were they actually going to enforce this ruling? Some children had to be accompanied to their new (white) school by National Guards, while others were eventually “bussed” to schools outside their district. 

The direction of the Civil Rights movement changed over the 1950s; going through the courts to marching in the street. The Civil Rights movement implemented de-segregation in other areas of social life through actions like the Montgomery Bus Boycott (which lead to the rise of Martin Luther King Jr.), or through direct actions, like sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. 

Many Berkeley activists had been involved with the Civil Rights Movement, and were familiar with these tactics. Direct action was used on a number of occasions, like in the occupation of Sproul Hall. 

The university adminstration ultimately loosened up, but by the time the movement was over, it had become a model for student activism worldwide. 

Student activism was everywhere by the end of the 1960s, whether it was against the Vietnam War or aligning with workers in revolution (May 1968 in France). 

In fact, many in the New Left saw themselves as being a vanguard of change along with other oppressed groups around the world. What was omitted was the working class of the advanced industrialized countries. As with today, the term “working-class” was often used as a synonym for the “white male working class.”

The working-class was supposedly bought off by capitalism, made comfortable by rising wages and glued to the “boob-tube”; it was no longer “revolutionary” or much of a threat. 

Many on the New Left, therefore, changed the primary agent of revolution from the working class in the advanced capitalist countries to students, people of color, women, queers, third world peasants, etc. 

Anybody but the working class in the “first world.” Some went so far as to claim that the main struggle was no longer the industrialized working class in the first world versus the capitalists, but the “third world” against imperialism. 

History has proven all of this to be incredibly misguided.
